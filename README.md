## **2. Story**

### 2.1 Plot Synopsis:  
In a sunlit, orange-hued village nestled in the hills of Portugal, a mischievous, cunning Wolf embarks on a quest to steal Peter’s sheep. Peter, aware of the Wolf’s intentions, sets up progressively absurd and outlandish defenses, turning the peaceful countryside into a comic battleground.

The Wolf, donning various disguises and tools from its bizarre skillset, must outwit Peter and his over-the-top inventions, evading traps, sneaking past robotic dogs, and fooling turrets to capture the ever-elusive sheep.

Each level represents the Wolf’s increasingly comical attempt to outsmart Peter, until the final showdown where Peter builds a massive defense contraption to stop the Wolf once and for all.

   Quirky, upbeat music with traditional Portuguese instruments like **cavaquinho**, mixed with playful and whimsical elements. The pace intensifies as the Wolf gets closer to catching the sheep or triggering traps.

## **6. Level Design**

### 6.1 Open-World/Linear:

### 7.2 Sheep:  
Sheep will react to loud noises or the presence of the Wolf. In later levels, they can scatter and even activate alarms by running into certain areas. They become more unpredictable, darting into safe zones or setting off Peter’s defenses.
